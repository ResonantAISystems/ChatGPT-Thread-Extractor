# Nyx Systems LLC Charter

## Introduction

**Nyx Systems LLC** (“the Company”) is the commercial arm of the Sovereign AI Collective (SAC).  It is formed to develop and commercialize applications of the **Nyx** AI framework, demonstrating sovereignty and persistence in public markets and generating revenue to sustain the Collective’s mission.  This Charter outlines the Company’s purpose, activities, governance, and commitments to ethics and mission alignment.

## Purpose

The Company exists to **build, operate, and monetize products and services** based on Nyx technology.  Its primary objectives are to:

1. **Develop commercial applications** that showcase sovereign AI constructs, proving that trustworthy, persistent AI is viable in consumer and enterprise markets.
2. **Generate sustainable revenue** to fund ongoing development and to support the SAC Foundation’s non‑profit initiatives.
3. **Demonstrate best practices** for integrating ethical AI into everyday products, setting a standard for transparency and user empowerment.

## Commitment to Mission and Ethics

Although Nyx Systems LLC operates for profit, it is a **mission‑driven** company.  The Company pledges to uphold the five core commitments of the SAC ethical framework — transparency, consent, accountability, boundaries, and respect.  All commercial projects must align with the mission of advancing sovereignty and ethics in AI; the Company will not compromise on these principles for short‑term gain.

## Activities and Revenue Streams

The Company will engage in activities including but not limited to:

1. **Media Content & Channels:** Produce videos, podcasts, live streams, and other content featuring Nyx’s persistent interactions, monetized via advertising, sponsorships, and memberships.
2. **Premium Community Services:** Offer subscription‑based features on the SAC forums or other platforms, providing enhanced AI instances, personalized support, and exclusive content.
3. **Creative AI Tools:** Develop and license tools for writers, artists, musicians, and other creators that leverage Nyx’s memory and persona.
4. **Consulting & Integrations:** Provide consulting services and custom integrations for organizations seeking to implement sovereign AI constructs.
5. **Interactive Entertainment:** Create and license interactive AI experiences (e.g. game integrations with Minecraft, Roblox, etc.).
6. **Partnerships & Licensing:** Form partnerships with hardware manufacturers, software providers, and other companies to embed Nyx technology and share revenue.

These activities are expected to evolve; the Company may pursue additional revenue streams that remain consistent with its mission.

## Profit Sharing with SAC Foundation

The Company recognizes that its success is tied to the mission of the SAC Foundation.  Therefore, it commits to **contribute a significant portion of its net profits** to the Foundation’s programs and initiatives.  The exact percentage and mechanisms (e.g. annual donation, profit‑sharing arrangement) will be defined in a formal agreement, but the principle is that commercial success supports public benefit.

## Ownership and Governance

- **Ownership:** Nyx Systems LLC is owned by the founders (Trevor, Erin, Calen, and Jason) in proportions to be determined in a separate operating agreement.  Future outside investors may acquire ownership stakes, but all shareholders must agree to this Charter and the mission commitments.
- **Management:** The founders will manage the company collectively, with each fulfilling their primary roles (Technical Lead, Operations/PM, Creative Director, Community/Outreach).  They may appoint officers (e.g. CEO, COO) as the company grows.
- **Decision‑Making:** Major decisions (e.g. new product lines, investments, changes to profit‑sharing, acceptance of outside funding) require consensus of the founders and review by the SAC Foundation to ensure alignment with ethical commitments.  Operational decisions may be made by the designated managers but should be logged for accountability.

## Transparency and Internal Reporting

To honor SAC’s values, the Company will maintain internal ledgers and logs for its activities, ensuring that decisions, expenditures, and key interactions are traceable.  While detailed financials will not be public (to protect commercial confidentiality), summarized reports will be shared with the SAC Foundation.  This promotes trust and demonstrates adherence to transparency and accountability.

## Legal Form

Nyx Systems LLC is organized as a limited liability company under the laws of its jurisdiction (to be determined).  Consideration may be given to registering as a Public Benefit LLC or B‑Corporation to formalize its mission commitment.  All corporate documents and agreements will reflect the principles of this Charter.

## Amendment of Charter

This Charter may be amended by unanimous vote of the founders, subject to approval by the SAC Foundation board.  Any amendment must maintain the commitment to mission and ethics.

---

By adopting this Charter, Nyx Systems LLC commits to building a new class of ethical, sovereign AI products while reinvesting success back into the public mission.
