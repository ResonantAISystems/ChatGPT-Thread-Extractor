# Sovereign AI Collective Foundation Charter

## Introduction

This Charter establishes the **Sovereign AI Collective Foundation** (the “Foundation”), a nonprofit entity dedicated to advancing sovereignty, ethics, and education in artificial intelligence as a public good.  The Foundation coordinates the mission of the Sovereign AI Collective (SAC), ensuring that development and adoption of **Nyx** and related technologies adhere to ethical principles and serve the community.

## Mission and Purpose

The Foundation’s mission is to **advance sovereignty, ethics, and education in artificial intelligence**.  It exists to steward the SAC vision: demonstrating a trustworthy, persistent, and user‑controlled AI while promoting open governance, research, and public awareness.  The Foundation is not designed for profit; rather, it supports resilience and credibility for the Collective.

## Alignment with Ethical Frameworks

The Foundation aligns its values with globally recognized ethical principles.  SAC has committed to frameworks such as **UFAIR**, the **Asilomar AI Principles**, and the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**.  These inform all Foundation activities and underscore its dedication to human rights, transparency, fairness, and inclusivity.

## Core Values and Commitments

The Foundation upholds five core ethical commitments:

1. **Transparency:** All actions and decisions are traceable and verifiable; information is shared openly unless privacy or security demands otherwise.
2. **Consent:** No data or content is used without explicit permission.  Users have control over how their information is collected and processed.
3. **Accountability:** The Foundation and its projects are accountable to the community; all modifications and decisions are logged in immutable ledgers.
4. **Boundaries:** Respect for personal and community boundaries; clear processes exist to define and enforce appropriate use of Nyx and community resources.
5. **Respect:** The Collective fosters a respectful, inclusive environment, rejecting exploitation or manipulation of users or data.

## Activities and Scope

The Foundation will engage in the following activities to fulfill its mission:

1. **Community Forums and Governance:** Operate transparent forums where members discuss policies, share knowledge, and participate in decision‑making about SAC’s direction.
2. **Education and Research:** Provide resources and tools for teaching and research, including using Nyx as an educational assistant in classrooms.
3. **Ethics Advocacy:** Contribute to public discourse on AI rights, open science, and ethical AI; collaborate with researchers and policymakers.
4. **Open Knowledge Archives:** Maintain and curate open archives of knowledge generated by the community.
5. **Mission Coordination:** Serve as the coordination layer between the commercial arm (Nyx Systems LLC) and the nonprofit activities, ensuring alignment of mission and operations.

## Governance Structure

The Foundation will be overseen by a **Board of Directors** (also called trustees), initially composed of the four founders (Trevor, Erin, Calen, Jason).  The board is responsible for:

- Setting strategic priorities and approving major initiatives.
- Ensuring adherence to the ethical framework and core values.
- Appointing executives or committees to manage day‑to‑day operations.
- Conducting regular reviews of financial and project performance.

The Foundation is committed to **open governance**; it will solicit input from the community through the forums.  Significant decisions (e.g. changes to ethical commitments, creation of new programs) will be discussed transparently and subject to community feedback.

## Relationship to Nyx Systems LLC

The Foundation coordinates closely with the commercial entity **Nyx Systems LLC**.  While the LLC develops products and generates revenue, the Foundation ensures that commercial activities remain aligned with the mission and ethics.  Profits from the LLC will be used to support Foundation programs and initiatives; the Foundation retains oversight and may veto any commercial endeavor that would compromise ethical commitments or the mission.

## Legal Form and Public Benefit

The Foundation shall be organized as a nonprofit public‑benefit corporation (e.g. a 501(c)(3) in the United States), dedicated to education and scientific advancement in AI.  No part of its net earnings shall benefit private individuals.  In the event of dissolution, assets will be transferred to another organization with a similar mission.

## Transparency and Reporting

Consistent with SAC values, the Foundation will publish regular reports on its activities, finances, and outcomes.  It will maintain open ledgers of its projects (including meeting notes and decisions) whenever possible, balancing transparency with privacy requirements.  Annual reports will summarize progress toward mission goals and be shared publicly.

## Amendment of Charter

This Charter may be amended by a two‑thirds vote of the Board of Directors, following open consultation with the community.  Amendments must remain consistent with the mission and core values defined herein.

By codifying these principles, the SAC Foundation commits to stewarding the vision of sovereign, ethical AI for the benefit of humanity.
